# WEB SCRAPING WITH STREAMLIT

## Project Description

This project is a web scraping application developed using Streamlit and Python. The application scrapes doctor profiles from [Practo.com](https://www.practo.com/) based on user-provided location and specialization. It extracts information such as doctor's name, specialization, experience, clinic name, practice locality and consultation fees. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format within the Streamlit app.
